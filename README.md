simple-dungeons is a dungeon crawler game made in Dart. It is based off the physical board game League of Dungeoneers.

## Version Naming Scheme

v-A.B.C.D

A denotes a 'major release' version (basically an entire rewrite)
B denotes a 'minor release' version (ie a new feature that is helpful)
C denotes 'major-fixes' or 'minor feature release / major improvement' version (ie a game-breaking bug or making a tool function / adding easier mod support to a function)
D denotes a 'hotfix' version or 'minor improvement' (ie fixing a small formatting bug or removing 2 lines of uneccessary code)

An M after the v for version (vM) denotes a major version of a release, that does not increase the unit size. ie a chnage that is A level but not a major release. Would be vM-0.5.0.0 instead of vM-1.0.0.0

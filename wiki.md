## Rerolls

Rerolls may either be set to extended (default) or automatic. 

Extended rerolls will ask if you want to reroll (where eligible) and you have the option to say no.
Automatic rerolls will roll again regardless of any choice.
Both types will always choose the largest roll so there is no 'bad consequence' to rerolling. 
The advantage of automatic is time saving and much less text on the screen, however you may opt to use extended if you want to be 'honourable' with your rolling.

You may also choose to completely disable rerolling but this cannot be done via setup. If you change the Rule Map in rules.dart and change the value corresponding to the Rerolls key to Disabled then a normal roll will be ran. This is not recommended.
